(* *************
    Important lemma that shows the relation between alpha contexts and renamings
*)

(* We use bound and free because it is easier to reason about.
 e.g. x not free in any subterm of \x. y
 But it is bound in there.
  while in \x.x it is free in the subterm.
If we just take bound terms always as well, I think it is easier to reason.

Also, we need a freshness condition since renaming is not capture-avoiding.

Correspondence between alpha contexts and renamings on syntactically equal terms.

(* alpha contexts and renaming contexts work the same with shadowing, so this holds
  e.g. if R = (x, y)::(x, z), then mren will rename x to y.
  Also Alpha (x, y)::(x, z) x y holds
  Since the rhs of R can never occur in s, we know that also then z cannot occur in (mren R s)
*)
Lemma alpha_mren (R : list (string * string)) s :
  (* x' can be equal to x., but then x=x' not in s, so the renaming doesnt do anything. *)
  (forall x, In x (map snd R) -> ~ In x (ftv s)) -> Alpha R s (mren R s).
Proof.
Admitted.


(* what we want is:
Suppose   s = (x, y)
Suppose R = (x, y), then that is problematic of course (the y is already present)
But, if R is extended with (y, yfr), then this is no longer problematic.
In other words we need:
forall x, In x (map snd R) AND  In fst s  ->  Either: it is later somewhere in (fst R), i.e.: it gets fixed away

Thought experiment:
what if it gets fixed away to some other free var in s? Then it has to do this formula again, and needs to get fixed away again
Because it is folding over the structure, at some point it needs to be translated to something not in the ftvs

ok. What about
s = (x, y)
R = (x, y), (y, x)
should not be problematic. But why/how to encode this?


Hmm. I guess we could make sure that forall ftvs in s (in the original problem), we have a renaming in R (can be identity)
Then we can rename every ftv at the end of R to something fresh => then we can never have "capture"
*)
Lemma alpha_mren_hmm (R : list (string * string)) s :
  (* x' can be equal to x., but then x=x' not in s, so the renaming doesnt do anything. *)
  (forall x, In x (map snd R) -> ~ In x (ftv s)) -> Alpha R s (mren R s).
Proof.
Admitted.

(* Renamings can be faulty if we rename to something (say y) and y already occured in the term
  this inductive makes sure that when this occurs the "original" y also gets renamed to something unproblematic
*)
Inductive Nice : (list (string * string)) -> term -> Prop :=
  | NiceNil t : Nice nil t

  (* If we rename something to y, and that already occured in t, then we need to rename that away thereafter*)
  | NiceOne x y t R :  ~ In y (btv t) ->   In y (ftv t) -> In y (map fst R) -> Nice R t -> Nice ((x, y)::R) t
  | NiceTwo x y t R : ~ In y (btv t) -> ~ In y (ftv t) ->                     Nice R t -> Nice ((x, y)::R) t. (* Not a problematic renaming*)
(* for non-problematic renamings it can also not be in a bound type variable:
  look at R = (x, y) and t = (tmlam y. x).
*)

(*
  If R is nice, then the renaming is capture-avoiding.

  Forall R, we can create R' which is Nice by extending R with renaming all ftvs to fresh vars, that is the key here
  Also, if we extend R with identity substitutions, we can thereafter still do the extending by freshes.
  If already (x, y), (y, x) in R. And we extend with (x, xfr), (y, yfr), then this does nothing (shadowed)
  but what it does do is have an easy way of always knowing the renaming will be ok: we are playing on the safe side
*)

(* oooof.. Nice allows R = (x, y) and s = tmlam y. x y. Problem is that the rhs is a btv there.
  I think an "easy" fix is to assume nothing in rhs R appears in btv of s.
  I have nwo put this into nice
