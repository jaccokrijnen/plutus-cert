(* *************
    Important lemma that shows the relation between alpha contexts and renamings
*)

(* We use bound and free because it is easier to reason about.
 e.g. x not free in any subterm of \x. y
 But it is bound in there.
  while in \x.x it is free in the subterm.
If we just take bound terms always as well, I think it is easier to reason.

Also, we need a freshness condition since renaming is not capture-avoiding.

Correspondence between alpha contexts and renamings on syntactically equal terms.

Lemma alphaRename x x' s :
  (* x' can be equal to x., but then x=x' not in s, so the renaming doesnt do anything. 
    Cannot easily be restricted to ftv: say s = Î» x' . x. Then x' not free in s, but rename x x' s, will cause capture
